        <h2>360 Pier</h2>


        <div class="image">

        <div class="text">
            <p> This focus points that could draw users is the several stands lines along the pier. Users can easily navigate to those stands ans get a better look at each stand. Once the user is there could be sound that plays that is relevant to the stand. Or there could even be an interactive menu if the stand one that sells food or a small description of the aquarium could pop up once the users navigates to it. </p>

        <h2> 360 Mall</h2>


        <div class="image">

        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p> Similar to the Pier images, this 360 image has multiple stores in it and those stores could be hotspots where information is displayed. Each store can have a button that triggers a modal with the store's best selling items or basic information such as store hours and a link to their website. </p>

        <h2> 360 Dock </h2>

        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p> This 360 image doesn't have as many objects in it but I think the body of water can be a hotspot where users can get information. It can have information on the body of water itself like the name of it, what ocean animals live in there, if it is fresh water or salt water, etc.</p>
