            <p> The virtual store webvr is a useful way to view the store as it is. It mimics the experience of being in the store, you can head up the escalators and look around at the different items on display. Once you encounter a room display you'd like to see more in detail, you can easily "step" into that area and view it in 360 degrees. It also features markers on every item which once clicked, leads to a pop-up of that item with its description ans the ability to add it to your cart. </p>

        <div class="text">
            <p> This virtual experience is of the inside of the company's car models. While you are in the car, you are in the drivers seat and you can look all around the car and even see different pieces of information about the car with the circle markers provided. You can also customize the car's interior color and the car gear shift. The model is hyper realistic and the browser doesn't lag because of all the details present. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p> This virtual exhibition showcases the street art of many artists from around the world. Just like a real gallery, each piece is hung up on the walls accompanied by an artist's statement. If you want a closer look at the art, you can alwasy click on the piece and the art and the artist's statement will appear in a modal. There is also an option for users to play the recordings of all the text featured in the gallery if they would rather listen than read. One thing that stuck out the most to me was that you cannot walk through walls in this exhibition, unlike some other VR experiences. I think this makes it a bit more realistic because you cannot walk through the walls of a gallery in real life. </p>
